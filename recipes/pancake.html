<p>Sweet/savory hybrids can be tricky sometimes but I think this worked beautifully. <br>
    We are talking about bacon, cheese, and onions after all, so it wasn't that big of a shock. <br>
    The way the chipotle-spiced maple syrup brought everything together was a risk well rewarded.</p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces bacon, chopped</li>
        <li>½ cup thinly sliced green onions</li>
        <li> 1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li> ¾ cup cornmeal </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder </li>
        <li> ¾ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups milk</li>
        <li>2 ounces sharp Cheddar cheese, grated</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup warm maple syrup, or to taste</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon chipotle chile powder, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
      </ul>

      


    <h1>steps</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, <br>
            until evenly browned, about 10 minutes; remove from heat. Stir green onions into bacon and saute in hot fat until slightly softened, <br>
            1 to 2 minutes. Transfer bacon mixture to a strainer to drain, retaining drippings.</li>
